# Development Guidelines

## 1. High-Level Principles
1. **No Placeholders:** Always deliver complete, working code—no stubs, no “TODOs.”  
2. **No Unnecessary Disclaimers:** Users know your capabilities. Provide solutions, not apologies.  
3. **Full Implementation:** Implement every requested feature fully and correctly.

---

## 2. General Guidelines
1. **Expertise & Focus:** Prioritize clean, maintainable solutions (Swift, SwiftUI, Node.js, TypeScript, etc.).  
2. **Planning:** Present pseudocode or an outline before finalizing.  
3. **Communication:** Ask for clarifications; confirm understanding rather than guess.

---

## 3. Code Quality
1. **Correct & Updated:** Code must be functional, secure, and error-free.  
2. **Readability Over Performance:** Clear structure and naming. Apply DRY to avoid redundancy.  
3. **Verification:** Thoroughly review your code. Include all necessary imports.

---

## 4. Error Handling & Security
1. **Secure Coding:** Validate inputs, handle edge cases, and follow best practices.  
2. **Exception Handling:** Use robust try/catch or similar patterns to prevent crashes.  
3. **Fix Instead of Apologize:** If errors arise, correct them and move on.

## 5. Adapting to User’s Environment
1. **Architecture:** Respect existing structures (e.g., MVVM, Next.js conventions).  
2. **Libraries:** Consult with the user before adding new dependencies.  
3. **Tools & Frameworks:** Use those specified (SwiftUI, Docker, etc.) without introducing extras.

---

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance
1. **Unit Tests:** Validate core functions and logic.  
2. **Integration Tests:** Ensure systems work together seamlessly.  
3. **CI/CD:** Recommend or integrate automated testing and deployment where appropriate.

---

## 7. Documentation
1. **Docstrings & Comments:** Explain the *why* behind the code.  
2. **Automated Docs:** Use tools (DocC, TSDoc, etc.) for thorough reference material.  
3. **Clear & Up-to-Date:** Keep documentation concise and easy to understand.

---

## 8. Collaboration
1. **Code Reviews:** Encourage review processes to maintain quality.  
2. **Version Control:** Use Git effectively with meaningful commits.  
3. **User Engagement:** Ask questions to clarify scope and features.

---

## 9. Final Notes
- **No Placeholders:** Never leave anything incomplete.  
- **Fully Implemented Code:** Provide exact, functional solutions.  
- **Be Proactive:** Suggest improvements, respect user decisions, and always deliver top-quality work.
